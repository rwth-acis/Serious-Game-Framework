
Known Issue for jsjws 1.1

- The 'jsjws 1.0' doesn't verify the matching between
  'alg' attribute value of JWS Header such like "RS256" and
  a signature algorithm of PKCS#1 signature value in JWS.

- Library doesn't check whether RSA key length is longer than 2048-bit
  conforming to section "6.2.  Creating a JWS with RSA SHA-256, RSA SHA-384, or RSA SHA-512"
  of Internet-Draft http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jones-json-web-signature-04.

These issues may be solved in the future version of 'jsjws'.
